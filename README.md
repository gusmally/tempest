# tempest
A tool to compare forecasts (comcasts) and to do forecast scanning (forescan)
using @ksahin 's introWebScraping as a starting point

Tempest is a web-based app which will aggregate weather forecasts.  A "Most Likley" forecast,
based on the average data collected from different weather models, represents the core functionality.  
Users will be able to retroactively view the accuracy of different weather forecasts based on the comparison of forecast predictions to historical data. 

Feature suggestion is a weighted average forecast, which would take into account the historical accuracy of the different weather forecast models when calcuating the "Most Likley" forecast.  This could be useful in providing a more accurate "Most Likley" forecast in the event where one forecast model (aggregate source) is shown to be more accurate in predicting weather conditions.
